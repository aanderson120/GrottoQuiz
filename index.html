            <h1> Travel to the Forgotten Grotto</h1>
            <p>You are out walking in a valley and notice a cave entrance. Rumor has it, it's the secret enterance to the Forgotten Grotto. Hopefully you're good at breaking things and putting them back together, because you're going to need to flex those handy muscles to a 10 before you even try! Oh, and you only have 60 seconds and if you go down the wrong path you are going to loose 10 seconds, so think quick and don't get it wrong.</p>
